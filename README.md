# _Disneyland Clone - React Edition_

#### _Clone of the Disneyland.com website using React_

#### By _**Philip Eskins**_

## Description

_This application is my attempt at cloning http://www.disneyland.com_

## Current Features
* Video will actually play (refresh if it doesn't on first load)
* Nav bar has a nice drop down effect (for Parks & Tickets, Things to Do, and My Disneyland)
* Nav bar stays on top if you scroll downloading
* Attraction page (under Things to Do) lists three attractions (more to come)
* Attraction information is currently hard coded
* Can now add Adults and children

## Future Features
* Add dynamic links to get more information on attractions (in progress)
* Build out at least one more section of the home page (ie Offers and Benefits)


## Process

#### Sunday 4/28/19
_Was able to punch through the wall and figure out how to make the attraction detail page get the information it needed to display. I also was able to build out the offers section. Its not 100% correct but it just will take a little more time for styling._

#### Friday 4/26/19
_Got off to a great start with the project. Was able to get the buttons to add and remove people from the vacation bar. After that I tried to tackle displaying more details of attractions after you click on them. I ran into a wall and my brain sort of shut down. I came into the project with an idea of how to make it work, but it didn't pan out. Will think on it more over the weekend and if I still can't figure it out will get some assistance on Monday. Started work on the offers section in the meantime._

#### Friday 4/19/19
_Was able to pretty successfully recreate my angular Disneyland clone into React. Only thing missing is an attraction detail page, which I did try and get working but wasn't able to quite figure it out. I believe I'll be able to add it next week after I learn about states._
