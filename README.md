# _Disneyland Clone - React Edition_

#### _Clone of the Disneyland.com website using React_

#### By _**Philip Eskins**_

## Description

_This application is my attempt at cloning http://www.disneyland.com_

## Current Features
* Video will actually play (refresh if it doesn't on first load)
* Nav bar has a nice drop down effect (for Parks & Tickets, Things to Do, and My Disneyland)
* Nav bar stays on top if you scroll downloading
* Attraction page (under Things to Do) lists three attractions (more to come)
* Attraction information is currently hard coded

## Future Features
* Add dynamic links to get more information on attractions
* Get buttons to work to add more people to your party (currently its just hard coded)
* Build out at least one more section of the home page (ie Offers and Benefits)


## Process
#### Friday 4/19/19
_Was able to pretty successfully recreate my angular Disneyland clone into React. Only thing missing is an attraction detail page, which I did try and get working but wasn't able to quite figure it out. I believe I'll be able to add it next week after I learn about states._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download repository from https://github.com/PhilipEskins/disneyland-react/_
* _Type npm install from the command line interface_
* _Type npm run start from the command line interface_
* _If you'd like to alter or see the code for the project, after downloading open the project up in your favorite code editor._

## Known Bugs

_Video sometimes doesn't play on first load, might have to refresh to get it to play._
